# Automating deployment and installation of Vaultwarden

## What is Vaultwarden ? 

Vaultwarden is an alternative server implementation of Bitwarden.
Vaultwarden is an excellent open-source password manager. Your Vaultwarden server can be used as your primary password manager on your phone, 
web browser, and desktop. For privacy-focused tech-savvy individuals, it would only make sense to add it to your stack. 
Hackers aren't likely to target people who don't seem worth the effort, and if everyone had their own self-hosted password manager it would 
be even more of a headache to hack anything at all! This is unrealistic of course, but hosting your own Vaultwarden and getting off of big 
providers is a good way to go to keep your passwords safe.

## Goal
The objective of the project is to automate the installation process of Vaultwarden to a server.
